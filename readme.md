Creating a metric conversion web application.  I am constantly having to google or ask Alexa for some kind of conversion, because no matter how many times I've tried, I cannot visualize how hot 30 degrees celcius actually is, and it comes up in conversations too often.
Starting with a simple form, and I'll be using CSS for styling and JS to do the calculations for me.
Alexa is rooting for me.
